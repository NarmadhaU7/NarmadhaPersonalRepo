Main General Points:

In Euproean Countries, placements are done based on the concept like contractors get placed in the Client Company through Agency
and  1PS provides platform services and funds to deal with it. They act as bridge between Agency and client. They dont deal with contractors.

For Example:

client: Infosys
agency - any consultancy
contractor - IT Proffesional

1ps application users - Recruitment Agencies and Clients, Contractors
1ps main client -  Agency

All the entities are onboarded by creating a profile for them in the 1PS system before creating a placement between a contractor, agency, and client

MAJOR  ENTITIES:
1.  Clients -  have vacancy and offer a position to a suitable contractor through an agency(except directly recruit for permanent placements) 
( unique client Reference Number)
        Temporary and permannet roles.
		
2.  Agency - providing recruitment services to an end client ( unique Agency Reference Number and Unique Name)

3. Contractor - contractor is an individual hired for a position by the client 
They get paid through umbrella company or limited company.

Umbrella Company -  third party companies for financial management of clients.
1PS would pay the contractorâ€™s gross salary for which umbrella company applies the correct tax deductions for the contractors and pay the net salary.  

Limited Company - 1PS would pay the gross amount directly to the limited company that is then responsible to pay the correct taxes to HMRC.
